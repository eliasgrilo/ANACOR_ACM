Correspondence Analysis, whether simple or multiple, are suitable techniques for working with data that manifest in a qualitative manner, without the intention of making predictions for observations not present in the sample.

When the number of variables of interest is equal to 2, we use Simple Correspondence Analysis (ANACOR, from its Portuguese acronym); on the other hand, when the number of variables of interest is greater than 2, we use Multiple Correspondence Analysis (ACM, from its Portuguese acronym).

Simple Correspondence Analysis is a method used to visualize the relationships between two categorical variables in a dataset, by displaying their categories in a two-dimensional space.

Multiple Correspondence Analysis extends this method to more than two categorical variables, creating a map that reveals the underlying structures and relationships within the dataset. This method is particularly useful for understanding the patterns in complex, multi-dimensional data.

Therefore, the idea is to study interdependent relationships due to the associations between the categories of variables of interest.

The main goal of Correspondence Analysis is to establish a perceptual map. A perceptual map is a type of graph that uses coordinates to represent the rows and columns of a contingency table.

In this perceptual map, similar categories are displayed closer to each other while different categories are further apart. This allows for visual exploration and interpretation of the patterns, similarities and differences in the data. It is especially useful when dealing with high dimensional categorical data, as it simplifies the complexity by mapping it into a two-dimensional space.
